# effect-mapping
Map effects of interest in neuroimaging to brain locations. 
This simple MATLAB code maps effects of interest derived from multivariate analysis in fMRI performed using GIFT (http://mialab.mrn.org/software/gift/) 
to reverse inference maps or 'cogmaps' derived from Neurosynth.
If you use this code, please cite our paper in Human Brain Mapping:
